## FAQ

### 1. How to use

You can start VPN connection by clicking the rounded button on the home above.

### 2. Connect mode

1）Norm：You can use this mode at once and no timeout. Your connection will be ok as long as the server is healthy. But the network speed is also standard, or maybe a little slow. It's not suitable for watching video or live stream;

2）Fast：You can use this mode at once and the network should be fast enough to watch video. But there is a 2 hours timeout limit. Your connection will be interrupted after 2 hours, but you can re-connect again and there is no limit how many times you want to connect;

3）Super：Your connection is Super fast. But you should earn coins first and then exchange transfer with your coins. Your transfer will be consumed while connecting to network with this mode.

### 3. Earn coins

You can earn coins by watching ads which provided by Google. For example, you can check-in/play slot games or watch Ads Video to earn coins freely. The ads is provided by Google, which is out of our control. You might need to connect to different global server in some regions to see the ads.

### 4. Deposit Coin


In some cases, for example, when you need to delete the APP for reinstallation or downgrade of the APP version, in order to protect the  coins you have obtained, you can temporarily store the APP's coins on the phone storage. After temporarily storing gold coins, the APP cannot read the gold coin data. The APP will show that the gold coins are 0 and the traffic is 0. After downgrading the APP or clearing the APP data, click "Recover" to restore the previously deposited gold coins.

The validity period of coin deposit is 6 hours. If the coin is not restored within 6 hours after deposit, the coins will be invalid and cannot be recovered.

Note: When using this function, you need to provide additional mobile phone storage permissions. No storage permissions are required when not using this feature.
